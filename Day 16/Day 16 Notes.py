#TODO: Procedural Programming
#Computer is working top to bottom, procedurally.
#This is pretty much how we"ve been going through it so far.

#TODO: OOP: Object Oriented Programming
# Modelling parts of programming on real life objects,
# Splitting a task into smaller pieces. Smaller parts that perform independently.
#For example, creating individual smaller modules doesn't just
#break up today's task, but also increases reusability and scalability.

##TODO:  Attributes
# Attributes = a variable that is associated with a modeled object.
# It isn't a floating variable, it is attached to something.
# ex. in a restaurant program, a Waiter object may have attributes like is_holding_plate = True.

##TODO: Methods
#Functions, but attached to a modeled object.
#ie, our Waiter object would have method such as
# def take_payment #takes money to the till, or
#def take_order #takes order to the chef

##TODO: Class
#A 'blueprint' for a type of object.
#For example, our waiter object, once he is written, can be copied over and over
#to generate more of the same thing.
#Waiter would be the Class, while Bill, Betty, etc. are the objects.

##TODO: What it looks like:
#Actually using the "blueprint" of a class to create an object, looks like this:
#if there is a blueprint for a car, and toy want to make a car:

#car = CarBlueprint()
##CarBlueprint is the CLASS, car is the OBJECT
#You can make any object this way and name it whatever.
#(And yes, the capitalization is important, it separates Classes from other variables etc.

#TODO: TURTLE GRAPHICS
#is installed with every copy of Python.
####(Play with this more in a separate file)
###>> day16-start.py

#TODO: When an object is created from a class, you can access its attributes like:
#car.speed
#TODO: it also has Methods, or defined functions associated with it
#car.stop() ##Calling the Method(function) of stop

#TODO: PYTHON PACKAGES
#Unlike a module, a pAckage is loooots of code packaged together.
